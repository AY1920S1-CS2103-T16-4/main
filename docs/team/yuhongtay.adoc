== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added * The ability to set reminders.*
** What it does: allows the user to receive notifications for upcoming events (such as making a future purchase) or other user-specified events.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because users will be able to keep track and better regulate their spendings.
** Highlights: This enhancement was highly extensive to implement. Due to their stateful nature, reminders have to appropriately and efficiently respond to the wide variety of changes made to the guilTrip() databank while minimising coupling as much as possible. A efficient and more or less self contained system was required.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** TimeUtil which periodically updates the app with the currebt local date.
** Implemented Add, Edit, Delete and Search functions for Wish entry class.
