== PROJECT: guiltTrip()
---
==== Overview

Craving for a nice bowl of Mala but canâ€™t seem to save up enough for it? guiltTrip() is the perfect platform for those
*aspiring to be able to afford their Mala*, finally!

==== Summary of contributions
Data Presentation:

* *Major enhancement*: added *Statistics Breakdown along with Categories*
** What it does: allows the user to view the statistics of his spending, whether it be by daily through a bar chart or by category
through a table or pie chart. To facilitate the User's experience, categories are also introduce to allow breakdown by categories.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it helps the user to identify and notice his/her spending across categories
, thus finding out his spending trends and identify how to improve from there.
** Highlights: This feature involves calculation of statistics across a period of time, and hence requires an understanding of how the entries are saved to carry out calculation operations on them.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *Quality Of Life Features:Sort and Find Command*
** What it does: Allows the user to sort the list according to the fields of the entry. Also allows the user to find specific entries. Enhanced the find command of original AddressBook
to include allowing it to find for all fields of the entry.
** Justification: This feature improves the product as there is more Data Organization and the user can choose what data to see through find.
** Highlights: This feature involves sorting the exiting list of entries and filtering them, and hence requires an understanding of how the entries are saved to carry out calculation operations on them.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=dandford&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false[Functional code]]

|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._

=== Contributions to the User Guide

=== Categories
Categories allow for organization of data, and improves the breakdown of information for statistics.
For more information visit: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#31-categories

=== Statistics

==== Switching to Statistics Table View : `viewTable`
Switches to the statistics table view. By default, `viewTable` will show the current month statistics.
Typing only the month in format *[yyyy-mm]* will show the breakdown of statistics by the specified month.
Carrying out any other Adding, Editing, Or Deleting Expense or Income command in the Statistics Table
screen will reset the Table to show the month of statistics that reflects the command carried out.

Format: `viewTable [p/<RangeOfMonths>]`

* `<RangeOfMonths>`: The dates that you would like to display the statistics by. If you are interested in a range of months, you have to make sure that the *startMonth* and *endMonth* is separated by a comma, `,`. If you're only interested in one month, specify the month in the format `yyyy/MM`

Example Usage:

[start = 1]
. Let's say you want to view the Statistics in table form for period *2018/01* to *2019/12*. You then type in the command `viewTable p/2018-01,2019-12`.
+

. GuiltTrip will display to you the statistics for this period of time broken down in table form as shown below.
+

Other Examples:

* `viewTable p/2018-09`
* `viewTable`

==== Switching to Statistics Pie Chart View : `viewPie`
Switches to the statistics table view. By default, `viewPie` will show the current month statistics.
Typing only the month in format *[yyyy-mm]* will show the breakdown of statistics by the specified month.
Carrying out any other Adding, Editing, Or Deleting Expense or Income command in the Statistics Table
screen will reset the Table to show the month of statistics that reflects the command carried out.
The statistics by percentage will be rounded to the nearest 1 decimal place so as not to clutter the UI.

Format: `viewPie [p/<RangeOfMonths>]`

* `<RangeOfMonths>`: The dates that you would like to display the statistics by. If you are interested in a range of months, you have to make sure that the *startMonth* and *endMonth* is separated by a comma, `,`.

Example Usage:
[start = 1]
. Let's say you want to view the Statistics in pie chart form for period *2018/01* to *2019/12*. You then type in the command `viewPie p/2018-01,2019-12`.
+
image::ViewPie-1.png[width=50%]

. GuiltTrip will display to you the statistics for this period of time broken down in pie chart form as shown below.
+
image::viewPie-2.png[width=50%]

[NOTE]
If the data category percentage is too small, it could be rounded off to 0.0% and
there is a likelihood that it'll be hard to see the portion of that category in the pie chart.

Other Examples:

* `viewPie p/2018-09`
* `viewPie`

==== Switching to Statistics Bar Chart View : `viewBar`
Switches to the statistics table view. By default, `viewBar` will show the current month statistics.
Typing only the month in format *[yyyy-mm]* will show the breakdown of statistics by day by the specified month.
Carrying out any other command in the Statistics Bar Chart screen will reset the Bar Chart to show the current month
statistics for convenience of the user.

[NOTE]
As the bar chart is auto scaling to reflect the accuracy of the y-axis , if there is too large an expense for one day, it will be hard to see
the amounts for other days.

Format: `viewBar [p/<SpecifiedMonth>]`

* `<SpecifiedMonth>`: The month and year in which you want to display the data by. It must be in the format `[yyyy mm]` with no dates and does not allow a range of months.

Example Usage:

[start = 1]
. Let's say you want to view the Statistics in bar chart form for period *2019/10*. You then type in the command `viewBar p/2019-10`.
+
image::viewBar-1.png[width=50%]

. GuiltTrip will display to you the statistics for this period of time broken down in table form as shown below.
+
image::viewBar-2.png[width=50%]

Other Examples:

* `viewBar p/2018-09`
* `viewBar`

=== Sorting and Finding
Sorting allows the user to organize GuiltTrip to sort what he wants to see. For more information visit: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#31-categories
Finding allows the user to organize GuiltTrip to filter out what he wants to see. For more information visit: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#31-categories

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|_Given below are sections I contributed to the Developer Guide. They showcase my ability to write technical documentation and the technical depth of my contributions to the project._

==== Data Presentation: Categories
As the section for Categories is too huge, I included a small section on editingCategories command function.
