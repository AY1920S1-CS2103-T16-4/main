== PROJECT: GuiltTrip

---

== Overview

Craving for a nice bowl of Mala but canâ€™t seem to save up enough for it? guiltTrip() is the perfect platform for those
*aspiring to be able to afford their Mala*, finally! More importantly, guiltTrip() is optimized for those who prefer to
work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can
type fast, guiltTrip() can get your finance tracker tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
