== PROJECT: GuiltTrip

---

== Overview

Craving for a nice bowl of Mala but canâ€™t seem to save up enough for it? guiltTrip() is the perfect platform for those
*aspiring to be able to afford their Mala*, finally! More importantly, guiltTrip() is optimized for those who prefer to
work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can
type fast, guiltTrip() can get your finance tracker tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Summary of contributions
Data Presentation:

* *Major enhancement*: added *Statistics Breakdown along with Categories*
** What it does: allows the user to view the statistics of his spending, whether it be by daily through a bar chart or by category
through a table or pie chart. To facilitate the User's experience, categories are also introduce to allow breakdown by categories.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it helps the user to identify and notice his/her spending across categories
, thus finding out his spending trends and identify how to improve from there.
** Highlights: This feature involves calculation of statistics across a period of time, and hence requires an understanding of how the entries are saved to carry out calculation operations on them.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *Quality Of Life Features:Sort and Find Command*
** What it does: Allows the user to sort the list according to the fields of the entry. Also allows the user to find specific entries. Enhanced the find command of original AddressBook
to include allowing it to find for all fields of the entry.
** Justification: This feature improves the product as there is more Data Organization and the user can choose what data to see through find.
** Highlights: This feature involves sorting the exiting list of entries and filtering them, and hence requires an understanding of how the entries are saved to carry out calculation operations on them.

== Contributions to the User Guide

=== Categories
Ever feel like your list of expenses are extremely messy? This is where categories come in handy! Every entry belongs to one category, which makes it easier for you to organize your data! Categories can be either grouped under Expense or Income.
GuiltTrip comes with a default set of Categories as listed below. All entries must have a category.

* Income: `Business,Salary,Gifts,Loans`
* Expense: `Food,Travel,Family,Bills,Entertainment,Transport,Shopping,HealthCare,Groceries,Rent`

Categories for Expense, Budget and Wish all belong under the Expense Category. Categories for Income belong under the Income Category.
An example would be when creating a new Budget, the category that the budget was created must belong to one of the existing categories in Expense.

==== Adding Category : `addCategory`
If the default set of categories does not cover your needs, you can add more by calling addCategory.

Adds a new Category for either Income or Expense. The category added must not currently exist in the application.
Category names are case-insensitive.

Format: `addCategory cat/<category type> n/<category name>`

* `<category type>`: The type of Category that the new addition is under.
* `<category name>`: The name of the new Category.

Example Usage:
[start = 1]
. If you want to add a new category *CodingServices* under Income, enter the command `addCategory cat/Income n/CodingServices`
+
image::addingCategory-1.png[]

. The new category will thus be added to guiltTrip. You can verify it using `listCategories`.
+

Other Examples:

* `addCategory cat/Expense n/Transport`
* `addCategory cat/Income n/Lottery`

===== Editing Category : `editCategory`
Edits a current category's description. The category to be edited must exist in the current list of Categories
whether it be in the Expense CategoryList or the Income CategoryList. The new name for the category must not be a
duplicate of existing categories.

Format: `editCategory cat/<category type> o/<old category name> n/<new category name>`

* `<category type>`: The type of Category that the edited Category is under.
* `<old category name>`: The original name of this Category.
* `<new category name>`: The new name of this Category.

Example Usage:
[start = 1]
. If you would like to edit an existing Category *Business* to *Bursary* under Income, enter the command `editCategory cat/Income o/Business n/Bursary`.
+
image::editingCategory-1.png[]

. The old category will thus be edited in guiltTrip. All existing entries will also be renamed as shown below.

Other Examples:

==== Listing Categories : `listCategories`

Lists all the current categories the user has.

Format: `listCategories`

==== Deleting Category : `deleteCategory`
Deletes a category from guiltTrip. The category that is deleted should not have any entries under it. It must also already exist in guiltTrip.

Format: `deleteCategory cat/<category type> n/<category name>`

* `<category type>`: The type of Category that the deleted Category is under.
* `<category name>`: The name of the deleted Category.

Example Usage:
[start = 1]
. If you would like to remove an existing Category *Rent* under Expense, type `deleteCategory cat/Expense n/Rent`
