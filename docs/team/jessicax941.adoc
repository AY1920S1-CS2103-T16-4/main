== PROJECT: GuiltTrip

== Overview

GuiltTrip is a finance tracker application, optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, GuiltTrip can get your finance tracker tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Users can track their spending, incomes, wishlist items and budgets all in one place. They could also add recurring expenses that will add expenses for users automatically based on a given frequency.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to customise the look of UI*

** What it does: allows the user to toggle specific panels on and off, change the font and theme of the application. The font and theme settings are also saved.

** Justification: This feature improves the product by a moderate degree as it gives the user ability to change the look of the GUI to their liking. Because these settings are saved, when the user launches the application again, it is already in the user's preferred settings. As we are targeting young people who often like to customise the look of their applications (light/dark theme, type of font used), we believe that making the GUI customisable will draw our target users in and encourage them to continue using the application.

** Highlights: This enhancements supplements some of the existing commands as it allows the user to view other entries such as Budgets, Wishes and AutoExpenses or not to view them, by toggling those panels off.

* *Minor enhancement*:

** Implement specific `add`, `delete` and `edit` commands for Expense and Income to maintain consistency (previously was one `add`/`delete`/`edit` command for both Expense and Income while Wish, Budget, AutoExpenses had their own commands).

** Improve `listBudget` and `listWish` to replace budgets/wishes with expenses and incomes in the main panel. Thus this allocates more space for the user to view budgets or wishes, whenever the user wants to.
