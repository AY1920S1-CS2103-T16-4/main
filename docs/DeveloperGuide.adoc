== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of UI component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

* The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EntryListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

* The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in
link:{repoURL}src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.

* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the `UI` can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `guiltTripParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Guilt Trip data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Entry>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage`

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.
* This includes instances of Entry subclasses(Expense, Income, Wish, AutoExpenditure, Budget, TrackerReminder, etc.)
* DateReminder data are stored in Entry data.

[[Design-Statistics]]
=== Statistics component

.Structure of the Statistics Component
image::StatisticsClass.png[]

.  `Statistics` contains an ObservableMap of `MonthlyList` class.
.  `MonthlyList` contains an ObservableMap of `DailyList` class.
.  `DailyList` contains an ObservableMap of `CategoryList` class.
.  These lists are populated when the guiltTrip() is started up and the content is retrieved from Storage.
.  Any added entries are updated in the `CategoryList` and `DailyList` classes.

== Implementation
This section describes some details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Data Presentation: Sort Command

==== Implementation

The sort command extends the Command class. It works on the SortedList by adding a Comparator to the List. By default, the EntryList is sorted by date.

. The user executes the command `sort typ/Expense s/ascending`
.  `Logic` uses the `guiltTripParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `SortCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The `SortCommand` calls the `Model` 's sortFilteredEntryList to sort the list of entries.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  `Logic` returns the `CommandResult` object.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("sort typ/Expense s/ascending")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::SortSequence.png[]

=== ViewHistory Command

==== Implementation

The viewHistory command extends the Command class. It calls methods from the Statistics Manager which handles the calculation of the statistics and returns it to the user.

. The user executes the command `viewHistory typ/Expense`
.  `Logic` uses the `guiltTripParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `viewHistoryCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The `viewHistoryCommand` calls the `Model` 's generateHistory method which calls on the `StatisticsManager` generateHistory method to calculate the statistics for that type.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  `Logic` returns the `CommandResult` object.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("viewHistory typ/Expense")` API call.

=== Toggle Panel Command

==== Implementation

The following sequence diagram shows how the toggle panel command works:

image::ToggleSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::ToggleActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

*Current method:* Toggle the panels from within MainWindow class.

Pros: Easy to implement.

Cons: Might not be as OOP as other designs.

=== Reminders

==== Implementation

The Reminder mechanism is facilitated by the Reminder class. Each Reminder object consists of a Condition class object which represents a set of conditions to be met. When all conditions are met, the reminder is activated and its message is displayed under the Reminder Pannel. The following class diagram helps to show how the classes are related.

image::ReminderClassDiagram.png[]

Different types of conditions are represented by subclassess which extend the Condition class.
To create a reminder, the user calls the method createReminder(int... indexes)
where indexes are the indexes of conditions in the condition list.

When an add/edit/delete command for any of the subclasses of Entry (Expense, Income, Wishes) is executed,
the ConditionList object is updated to see if any conditions have been met.

image::ReminderSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

*Current method:* Instance specific reminders are made known to the instance object, and the object is made known to the reminder. (i.e Such reminders trigger conditions are entirely based on a single Entry class object)

Pros: Allows fast method of keeping track of instance specific reminders when object is edited/deleted and loaded form storage.
Cons: Might not be as OOP as other designs.

=== Undo/ Redo

==== Implementation
The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedGuiltTrip`.
It extends `GuiltTrip` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `guiltTripStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedGuiltTrip#commit()` -- Saves the current finance tracker state in its history.
* `VersionedGuiltTrip#undo()` -- Restores the previous finance trackerk state from its history.
* `VersionedGuiltTrip#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone finance tracker state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`, `Model#undoGuiltTrip()` and `Model#redoGuiltTrip()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedGuiltTrip` will be initialized with the initial finance tracker state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single finance tracker state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th entry in the finance tracker. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`, causing the modified state of the finance tracker after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `guiltTripStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted finance tracker state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add typ/Expense...` to add a new expense. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`, causing another modified finance tracker state to be saved into the `guiltTripStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`, so the finance tracker state will not be saved into the `guiltTripStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the expense was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoGuiltTrip()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous finance tracker state, and restores the finance tracker to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial finance tracker state, then there are no previous finance tracker states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoGuiltTrip()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoGuiltTrip()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the finance tracker to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `guiltTripStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest finance tracker state, then there are no undone finance tracker states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoGuiltTrip()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the finance tracker, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`, `Model#undoGuiltTrip()` or `Model#redoGuiltTrip()`. Thus, the `guiltTripStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `guiltTripStateList`, all finance tracker states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add typ/Expense ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of finance tracker states.
** Pros: Easy to understand and implement.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedGuiltTrip`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
