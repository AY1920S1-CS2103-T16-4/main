== Introduction

Craving for a nice bowl of Mala but can’t seem to save up enough for it? guiltTrip() is the perfect platform for those
*aspiring to be able to afford their Mala*, finally! More importantly, guiltTrip() is optimized for those who prefer to
work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can
type fast, guiltTrip() can get your finance tracker tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `guiltTrip().jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your guiltTrip.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `list` : lists all expenses and income
* `addAutoExp f/monthly n/drinks amt/11.99 cat/Food` : adds a recurring expense that will generate every day.
* `add cat/Food typ/Expense n/Mala amt/5.50 d/2019 09 09 tg/food tg/indulgence` : adds the specified expense to your
list of expenses
* `toggle wishlist` : toggles the wishlist panel
* `exit` : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
